**Median**

Median is the middle value of a set of data. To determine the median value in a sequence of numbers, the numbers must first be arranged in ascending order.

* If there is an odd amount of numbers, the median value is the number that is in the middle, with the same amount of numbers below and above.
* If there is an even amount of numbers in the list, the median is the average of the two middle values.
